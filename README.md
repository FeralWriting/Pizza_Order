# Pizza_Order
Program that receives a user's pizza order in the console. The program walks a user through ordering a pizza with slightly comedic dialogue. First, it establishes if a user wants a pizza. Then, helps them to contruct it. Finally, it asks if the user wants a drink and if their order is correct. This project uses Java. The project gave me experience with user interactability in Java, Visual Studio Code, utilizing information from the console, and if statements.
